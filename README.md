# Google Dark Search

**Note**: Add an issue on this project if you find any "light mode" remnants and I'll fix them.

This is a site theme to turn the Google Search website dark, also often described as 'Night Mode'.  

Chrome, Firefox, Opera Desktop Users: **First install the browser extension [Styl*us*](http://bit.ly/stylus-homepage) (not Stylish)** and *then* use this link: https://github.com/lonkle/google-dark-mode/raw/master/search/search.user.css

Safari Users: Simply use [Cascadea](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cascadea/id1432182561?mt=12), click the link above and it'll import it into Cascadea and it'll even auto-update for you as I update the styles to adjust to Google's never ending syntax changes.

Mobile Browsers: **UNSUPPORTED** (until I find a way)
